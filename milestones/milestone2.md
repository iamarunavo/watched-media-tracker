## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Our team made strong progress in defining the concept for the Watched Media Tracker. We were able to agree quickly on the main features and pages, including the Landing, Profile, and List pages. Brainstorming wireframes was productive, and everyone contributed ideas for how to make the app visually appealing and intuitive for users.]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 One challenge was figuring out how to organize different types of media — anime, movies, and shows — in a way that’s clear and easy to navigate. We also spent time deciding which features were essential for the first version and which could be saved for later, so the project remained realistic and manageable.]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 Moving forward, it would be helpful to have more guidance on designing the database with the correct relationships and connecting it to the frontend. Tips on fetching media data dynamically and displaying it efficiently in React, as well as advice on authentication and secure user data handling, would also be valuable.]
