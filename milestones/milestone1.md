## Reflection

### 1. What went well during this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 **Our group collaborated effectively and communicated frequently throughout the planning process. We quickly found common ground and shared enthusiasm for the "Watched Media Tracker" concept, particularly our mutual interest in anime and shows, which made brainstorming features straightforward.**]

### 2. What were some challenges your group faced in this unit?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 **One initial challenge was brainstorming a project idea that felt both unique and achievable, satisfying everyone's interests while trying not to replicate existing applications too closely. Settling on the specific scope took some discussion.**]

### 3. What additional support will you need in upcoming units as you continue to work on your final project?

[👉🏾👉🏾👉🏾 **Moving forward, we would appreciate clearer examples and perhaps more detailed instructions for the technical implementation steps, especially regarding database schema design with relationships and connecting the specific frontend components to the backend API endpoints.**]
