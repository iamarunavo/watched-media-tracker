# User Stories for Watched Media Tracker

Using the format: "As a \[user role], I want to \[action], so that \[benefit]."

## User Role: Registered User

1.  **As a Registered User, I want to add a new show/movie to my list by searching its title, so that I can begin tracking it.** (Assumes external API integration later, or manual entry for now)
2.  **As a Registered User, I want to see a visually appealing list or grid of all the shows/movies I am currently tracking, displaying their cover images and titles, so that I can get an overview of my tracked media.**
3.  **As a Registered User, I want to click on a show/movie in my list to view its details page, so that I can see its description, seasons, and episodes.**
4.  **As a Registered User, I want to mark an entire season of a show as 'watched', so that I can quickly update my progress for binge-watching.**
5.  **As a Registered User, I want to mark individual episodes as 'watched' or 'unwatched', so that I can precisely track where I left off in a series.**
6.  **As a Registered User, I want to see clearly which episodes/seasons I have already marked as watched on the show details page, so I don't get confused.**
7.  **As a Registered User, I want to remove a show/movie entirely from my tracked list, in case I drop it or added it by mistake.**
8.  **As a Registered User, I want to filter my tracked list by the platform (e.g., Netflix, Crunchyroll, HBO), so I can see what I'm watching on a specific service.** (Custom Feature #1)
9.  **As a Registered User, I want the system to record the date when I mark something as watched, so I have a history of my viewing activity.** (Custom Feature #2)
10. **As a Registered User, I want the application to save my progress automatically when I mark something as watched, so I don't have to manually click a 'save' button.**
11. **As a Registered User, I want to search my tracked list by show title, so I can quickly find a specific show I've added.** (Potential additional feature)
